<!-- Supporting Idea (Topic Sentence) -->
<section>
    <details class="instructions">
        <summary>Supporting Idea (Topic Sentence) — instructions</summary>
        <p>
            This is the main idea your paragraph will prove; think of it as the thesis of your paragraph that supports your main thesis. 
            You created these in your Working Thesis tab, but they may have evolved as you found evidence and identified patterns in your 
            Evidence Clusters. This is a single sentence in which you state the idea clearly and avoid mentioning any sources. Your supporting 
            idea should show what the paragraph is about and how it connects to your thesis.
        </p>

<!-- Evidence 1 -->
<section>
    <details class="instructions">
        <summary>Evidence 1 — instructions</summary>
        <p>
            Choose the strongest evidence that supports your idea. Evidence should be specific and accurate. Remember: you can use evidence 
            from your Source Notes. Make sure it helps prove the point you are making. Do not copy long sections or summary statements from 
            your sources; try to keep direct quotes below 35 words.

    <h4>Why it matters</h4>
    <p class="sub-instructions">
        Explain briefly why this piece of evidence is useful for your paragraph. What does it show? Focus on relevance and strength, not your full analysis.

<!-- Evidence 2 -->
<section>
    <details class="instructions">
        <summary>Evidence 2 — instructions</summary>
        <p>
            Choose another strong piece of evidence that supports your idea. Evidence should be specific and accurate. Remember: you can use 
            evidence from your Source Notes. Make sure it helps prove the point you are making. Your second piece of evidence should relate 
            to your first piece in some way. Do not copy long sections or summary statements from your sources; try to keep direct quotes below 35 words.
        </p>

    <textarea id="evidence2" placeholder="Evidence 2"></textarea>

    <h4>Why it matters</h4>
    <p class="sub-instructions">
        Explain briefly why this piece of evidence is useful for your paragraph. What does it show? Does it build on the other evidence? Focus on relevance and strength, not your full analysis.

</section>

<!-- Commentary -->
<section>
    <details class="instructions">
        <summary>Commentary / Reasoning — instructions</summary>
        <p>
            Explain how each piece of evidence helps prove your supporting idea. Do not repeat what the evidence says. Focus on the thinking: 
            what the evidence shows, why it matters, and how it connects back to your point. This step turns information from your sources into your own argument.
        </p>
